## Objective 
 The main objective of this project is to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard that allows users to easily understand and analyze car sales data. The dashboard consolidates multiple data sources, including a custom calendar table, into a single, interactive interface, enabling users to identify sales patterns, monitor key performance indicators, and make data-driven decisions.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Modeling:

-- Imported the car sales data and created a custom calendar table with relevant date-based dimensions (year, month, week, etc.).

-- Modeled the data by relating the calendar table to the existing car data table, enabling cross-filtering and analysis across multiple dimensions.


### 2. Measures Calculations:

-- Defined various measures, such as YTD Total Sales, YTD Average Price, YTD Car Sold, and sales growth/decline metrics.

-- Calculated these metrics to provide a holistic view of car sales performance.


### 3. Dashboard Development:

-- Designed an interactive dashboard layout with intuitive navigation and filtering options.

-- Incorporated visual elements, including charts, tables, and KPIs, to effectively communicate the sales data.

-- Implemented interactive features, such as drill-down capabilities and dynamic filters, to allow users to explore the data in-depth.
